# Homelab-Boot-up

Goal is having a single program or script that I can run, that will boot up all of my servers at the same time.

Will need to use ipmitool and Intel AMT commands while being passed a single set of credentials as switches.
While commands could be broadcast, it's probably smarter to manually program? I'll have to experiment and try.
